Adds a Multi-Admin Log menu in the Admin section of WordPress for Site Administrators to add Logs.

== Description ==

Up until now, the way Agencies organize and manage the developers for work on various sites has been through email, chat or even phone calls.

What Multi-Admin Log does is give agencies a simpler way to keep track of what each developer does on each of their client's WordPress sites.

So with this plugin, Agencies have a permanent record of all the changes and work done on each site by all the developers they hire, and future developer also don't need to speculate and guess what has been done, but can simply use this plugin to read the logs.

Multi-Admin Log is a must for WordPress Development agencies that manage multiple sites and have multiple developers.
